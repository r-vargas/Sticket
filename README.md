# Sticket

Final project repository for ME310. Year-long project for Manutencoop Private Sector Solutions focuses on building management services. This Android application connected to a server via RESTful API to interact with hardware "Stickets". 

These hardware "Stickets" are WiFi-enabled, and integration with an indoor location vendor provides building managers the position of maintenance problems. The hardware devices also featured indicator LEDs, which change color as progress on the maintenance issue is made.
